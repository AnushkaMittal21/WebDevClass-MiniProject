        <h1>About India</h1>
        <p>India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[26] is a country in South Asia. It is
            the
            seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in
            the
            world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal
            on
            the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the
            north;
            and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and
            the
            Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.
            <br><br>
            Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[27][28][29]
            Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region
            highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled life emerged on the
            subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into
            the
            Indus Valley civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[31] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an
            Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest,[32][33] unfolding as the language of
            the
            Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[34] The Dravidian languages of India were
            supplanted in the northern and western regions.[35] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste
            had
            emerged within Hinduism,[36] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to
            heredity.[37] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based
            in
            the Ganges Basin.[38] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[39] but also
            marked by
            the declining status of women,[40] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of
            belief.[g][41] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious
            cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[42]
            <br><br>
            In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on
            India's
            southern and western coasts.[43] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern
            plains,[44] eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan
            networks of medieval Islam.[45] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting
            composite Hindu culture in south India.[46] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised
            religion.[47] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48] leaving a
            legacy
            of luminous architecture.[h][49] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed,
            turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule
            began
            in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were
            introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root.[53] A pioneering and
            influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major
            factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two
            independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion
            of
            Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[60]
            <br><br>
            India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a
            pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to
            1.211 billion in 2011.[61] During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64
            annually
            to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in
            1951,[62] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services,
            with
            an expanding middle class.[63] It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed
            extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in
            global
            culture.[64] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing
            economic
            inequality.[65] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has
            disputes
            over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[66] Among
            the
            socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[67] and rising levels
            of
            air pollution.[68] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[69] Its forest cover
            comprises 21.7% of its area.[70] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in
            India's culture,[71] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.
